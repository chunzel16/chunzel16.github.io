## CS460 Homework
The following pages document my homework entries for the first installment of Western Oregon University's year-long Senior Sequence class.

The pages include a demo and a code breakdown that addresses each of the tasks in the assigned homework as well as any references and planning materials used used (I tend to draw myself a lot of concepts when programming...).
